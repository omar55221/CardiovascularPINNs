Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are a novel approach in the field of machine learning that integrate physical laws into the training process of neural networks. This integration is achieved by incorporating differential equations that govern physical processes directly into the loss function used to train the network. As a result, PINNs are capable of learning and making predictions that are consistent with known physical principles. This makes them particularly valuable for solving complex scientific and engineering problems where traditional data-driven models might struggle due to the scarcity of training data or the complexity of the underlying physical processes. By leveraging the structure and constraints provided by physical theories, PINNs can efficiently predict outcomes, simulate processes, and even discover new insights within fields such as fluid dynamics, material science, and climate modeling, among others.
